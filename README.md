# FSM_ActivityDetection
A Simple Finite State Machine based framework for activity detection

This project implements a simple FSM based framework to detect activities. Activities are classified into lower level and higher level activities.
Lower level activities are defined in terms of the transition of a person between certain pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs)
in the scene. Higher level activites are defined in terms of lower level activities and other higher level activities.
